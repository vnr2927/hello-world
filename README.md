Vicki's Intro to GitHub
{#HELLO WORLD!!}
Good afternoon, thank you for taking the time to read my GitHub introduction.  I, Victoria, am a new comer to the world of data analytics & data science.  I became fascinated by the field once I completed a Coursera course, Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.  I am using this education to launch my remote work career.  I have an interest in helping others & am looking forward to combining my current skill set as an EMT, with my new education.  Ideally, I am looking for work in the non-profit or government sectors, where I will be able to contribute to helping those in need.
